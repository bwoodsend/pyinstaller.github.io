Funding |PyInstaller|
=============================

.. container:: fundraisingbox

   Maintaining |PyInstaller| is a huge amount of work.
   |PyInstaller| development can only continue
   if users and companies provide sustainable funding.
   Otherwise issues and pull-requests will be left to linger
   until somebody can’t afford to not fix them.

   While PyInstaller is a voluntary project,
   the maintainers need to make their living.
   Each day they spend on other (paid) projects
   is missing for |PyInstaller|.

   **Please fund generously to keep PyInstaller development up at speed.**

   Thanks!

Funding by Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. container:: fundraisingbox

   If your company uses from |PyInstaller|,
   please consider funding work on some issue,
   some days of full-time development
   or conclude a maintenance contract.

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can’t afford
to not fix them.

Contact `Hartmut Goebel <mailto:h.goebel@crazy-compilers.com>`_ to arrange a
grant for a core developer.

We also welcome your patronage on Bountysource:

* Contribute a recurring amount to the team

* Place a reasonable bounty on a specific feature
  (Please keep in mind that high-quality development is time-consuming
  and 100 € wouldn't get you far.)

Your contribution will go towards adding new features to |PyInstaller| and
making sure all functionality continues to meet our high quality standards.
