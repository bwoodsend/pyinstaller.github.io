================

While PyInstaller is a voluntary project, the maintainers need to make their
living. Each day they spend on PyInstaller is missing for other, paid
projects. **So please help keeping PyInstaller alive.** Thanks!

Sponsorship and  Project Grant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please consider sponsoring |PyInstaller| development, especially if your
company benefits from this project.

We welcome your patronage on Bountysource:

* Contribute a recurring amount to the team
* Place a bounty on a specific feature

Your contribution will go towards adding new features to |PyInstaller| and
making sure all functionality continues to meet our high quality standards.

A grant for contiguous full-time development has the biggest impact for
progress. Periods of 3 to 10 days allow a contributor to tackle substantial
complex issues which are otherwise left to linger until somebody can’t afford
to not fix them.

Contact `Hartmut Goebel <mailto:h.goebel@crazy-compilers.com>`_ to arrange a
grant for a core contributor.

Huge thanks to all the companies and individuals who financially contributed
to the development of |PyInstaller|. Please send a PR if you’ve donated and
would like to be listed on the web-site.
